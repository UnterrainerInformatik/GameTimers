      Here are some Game-Timers to reduce boilerplate code in your games...

    <summary>
      When programming a game you'll depend on timers heavily. Whether you have a damage effect, that needs to be calculated every x seconds, or a visual special effect to be controlled, you'll steer all that by adding time to variable and checking it against a limit. Like with every work that gets repetitive, you'll get sloppy and you'll make mistakes. And it's precisely for this reason that I wrote these classes.
      This is a PCL (portable code library) so you should be able to use it in any of your MG projects.
